TetraScience Scientific Data Cloud Elasticsearch Examples

## Overview

Our [Public API](https://developers.tetrascience.com/reference/introduction-1) provides a method to query your data using elasticsearch. [Self-Service Pipelines](https://developers.tetrascience.com/docs/set-up-your-environment-and-initialize-ts-sdk) built and deployed onto our platform also have the ability to search the platform with elasticsearch queries. Several of our [Connectors](https://developers.tetrascience.com/docs/tetra-connectors), such as our [IDBS](https://developers.tetrascience.com/docs/tetra-idbs-connector) and [Signals](https://developers.tetrascience.com/docs/tetra-signals-connector) Connectors, use elasticsearch to find data to pull into ELN spreadsheets. And finally, you can use raw EQL in the platform UI to query data. This repo of examples provides some basic and advanced elasticsearch queries you can leverage for your own purposes.

## Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community that document additional elasticsearch queries that can help accelerate scientific workflows. [Here are more details on how to contribute.](https://github.com/tetrascience/ts-scientific-data-and-ai-cloud-elasticsearch-examples/blob/main/Contributing.md)
